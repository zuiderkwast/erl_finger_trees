Erlang 2-3 Finger Trees
=======================

An Erlang implementation of 2-3 finger trees as described on the page http://staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html:

> We present 2-3 finger trees, a functional representation of persistent sequences supporting access to the ends in amortized constant time, and concatenation and splitting in time logarithmic in the size of the smaller piece. Representations achieving these bounds have appeared previously, but 2-3 finger trees are much simpler, as are the operations on them. Further, by defining the split operation in a general form, we obtain a general purpose data structure that can serve as a sequence, priority queue, search tree, priority search queue and more.
